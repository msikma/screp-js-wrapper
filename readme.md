# screp-js

A pure Javascript version of [screp](https://github.com/icza/screp), a StarCraft: Remastered replay file parser, compiled from the original Go version using [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

screp (StarCraft: Brood War Replay Parser) is a library for extracting information from StarCraft replay files. This simple wrapper library allows GopherJS, a compiler from Go to Javascript, to make it available for use in Node.

**It's recommended to use [screp-js-wrapper](https://github.com/msikma/screp-js-wrapper) instead of this package**, as it does additional processing to make the output identical to that provided by the screp command line tool, and is available for the browser as well.
